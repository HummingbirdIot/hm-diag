    API is for： 
    - retrieving information about hotspots 
    - genernal operation and maintenance

    Users can use `public` API integration, `inner` API integration is *NOT recommended* -- because inner API does not guarantee subsequent compatibility

    Unified return data structure:
    ```
    {
      "code": 0, 
      "data": {}  
      "message": “OK”
    }
    ```
    Unless otherwise specified, the `code` value is the same as the http status.
